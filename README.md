# Natural Systems Modeling Project

This project is an effort to generate intuitive understanding about the dynamics of natural resources using agent-based models (ABMs). 

# Agent-based Modeling

ABMs are unique from other models in that their grand function is to explore the phenomenon of interest rather than to make predictions.  This is possible by allowing the user to adjust the variables within the model and then observe the outcome in a visual manner.  Experimentation is possible upon completion of the model, allowing the user to generate a large volume of data over different values of the variables.

For this project, the NetLogo environment will be used to generate the models.  This is a simple piece of software that allows the user to quickly add variables, give the agents roles, then allow the phenomena to play out.  A web-based version of NetLogo is now available to explore this type of modeling:

This type of modeling is being used for this project as it allows the user to explore the landscape of possibilities that may contribute to a particular natural system.  The type of understanding necessary to make informed decisions relating to various ecosystems is generally only available to those individuals that spend a significant amount of time observing and interacting with the ecosystems firsthand.  This type of modeling may give an individual experience with the various phenomena that need observed within an ecosystem in order to understand it and make informed decisions.  It also provides an avenue for interdisciplinary talk among individuals with specialized knowledge by visually demonstrating how the two fields may interact and what factors are important for each.
