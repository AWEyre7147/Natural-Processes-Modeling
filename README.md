# Natural Processes Modeling Project

# Abstract

This project is an effort to generate a repository of agent-based models (ABMs) covering the dynamics of various natural processes.  Exploration of these models by an individual can facilitate an intuitive understanding of how certain resources change over time and how these changes can produce natural phenomena, including unintended consequences by human intervention.

# Introduction

-- change this --  3 paragraphs, one including philosophy, one about brainstorming/defining natural processes, one about the project as a whole (repository)

The project will begin with brainstorming which natural phenomena are going to be modeled and investigation into which ABMs already exist.  NetLogo already contains a plethora of informative ABMs that efficiently demonstrate various phenomena, such as climate change, erosion, prey/predator patterns, wild fires, and more.  Many additional models will be generated, particularly around natural resources to eventually move to a point where one can demonstrate how human intervention over time can lead to resource deficits and unintended environmental effects.  The grand goal of this project is to develop a repository of ABMs that cover a plethora of natural processes.   

# Agent-based Modeling

Agent-based models (ABMs) are unique from many models currently employed in that their grand function is to explore the phenomenon of interest rather than to prove a pattern exists or to make a prediction.  This is possible by allowing the user to adjust the variables within the model and then observe the outcome in a visual manner, similar to simulation.  Experimentation is possible upon completion of the model, allowing the user to generate a large volume of data over many values of the variables.  This data can be explored readily to identify over what conditions unique phenomena arise.  More can be learned about agent-based modeling below:

For this project, the NetLogo environment will be used to generate the models.  This is a simple piece of software that allows the user to quickly add variables, give the agents roles, then allow the phenomena to play out.  A web-based version of NetLogo is now available to explore this type of modeling:

The type of understanding necessary to make informed decisions about ecosystems is generally only available to those individuals that spend a significant amount of time observing and interacting with the ecosystems firsthand.  This type of modeling is being used for this project as it allows the user to explore the landscape of possibility that may contribute to particular natural phenomena.  It may give an individual experience with the various natural processes that need observed within an ecosystem in order to understand it and make informed decisions.  It also provides an avenue for interdisciplinary talk among individuals with specialized knowledge by visually demonstrating what factors are important for a particular ecosystem and how they interact.

# The Repository

The repository will be formatted with each branch from the main being a particular natural process to be modeled.  Two readme documents will be made available within each branch: the first will document any brainstorming/information that has been compiled (not yet strucutred), and the second will be the formatted contents of the NetLogo 'Info' tab for the particular model.  Codes for the models will be made publically available (not yet sure how to make available the contents of the 'interface' tab).

Experimentation will also be performed and individual experiments will be placed within their own branches within the model's contents.  These will contain a readme with a brief outline of experiment, particularly if there's any phenomenon that's being searched for, and the settings in NetLogo's 'BehaviorSpace' application
