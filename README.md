# Natural Processes Modeling Project

# Abstract

This project is an effort to generate a repository of agent-based models (ABMs) covering the dynamics of various natural processes.  Exploration of these models by an individual can facilitate an intuitive understanding of how certain resources change over time and may lead to certain natural phenomena, including unintended consequences by human intervention.

# Introduction

-- change this --  3 paragraphs, one including philosophy, one about brainstorming/defining natural processes, one about the project as a whole (repository)

The project will begin with brainstorming which natural phenomena are going to be modeled and investigation into which ABMs already exist.  NetLogo already contains a plethora of informative ABMs that efficiently demonstrate various phenomena, such as climate change, erosion, prey/predator patterns, wild fires, and more.  Many additional models will be generated, particularly around natural resources to eventually move to a point where one can demonstrate how human intervention over time can lead to resource deficits and unintended environmental effects.  The grand goal of this project is to develop a repository of ABMs that cover a plethora of natural processes.   

# Agent-based Modeling / Methods

ABMs are unique from many models currently employed in that their grand function is to explore the phenomenon of interest rather than to prove a pattern exists or to make predictions.  This is possible by allowing the user to adjust the variables within the model and then observe the outcome in a visual manner, similar to simulation.  Experimentation is possible upon completion of the model, allowing the user to generate a large volume of data over different values of the variables.  This makes it possible to demonstrate how over what conditions a particular phenomenon occurs.  More can be learned about agent-based modeling below:

For this project, the NetLogo environment will be used to generate the models.  This is a simple piece of software that allows the user to quickly add variables, give the agents roles, then allow the phenomena to play out.  A web-based version of NetLogo is now available to explore this type of modeling:

The type of understanding necessary to make informed decisions relating to various ecosystems is generally only available to those individuals that spend a significant amount of time observing and interacting with the ecosystems firsthand.  This type of modeling is being used for this project as it allows the user to explore the landscape of possibilities that may contribute to a particular natural system.  It may give an individual experience with the various phenomena that need observed within an ecosystem in order to understand it and make informed decisions.  It also provides an avenue for interdisciplinary talk among individuals with specialized knowledge by visually demonstrating what factors are important for each phenomena and how they may interact.
